This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. Install node*modules using \_npm i --legacy-peer-deps* : using --legacy-peer-deps as one of the 3rd party captcha library is based on an older version of react. However this doesnt effect the production and also a better library for captcha can be used

2. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
